# Hello there.
This is my awesomewm config folder. Probably the worst
possible codebase you've ever laid your eyes upon. Hopefully
I'll manage to make it better someday. I'm neither a
programmer nor do I know lua, so possibly someday might
never come.

##TODO:
* refactor the wibar part of rc.lua
* taglist looks horrible, make it look better.
