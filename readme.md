# Hello there.
This is my awesomewm config folder. Probably the worst
possible codebase you've ever laid your eyes upon. Hopefully
I'll manage to make it better someday. I'm neither a
programmer nor do I know lua, so possibly someday might
never come.

## TODO:
* make another widget on the sidebar for minimized windows from
  all workspaces
* make a file launcher, preferably like fzf
* make a scratchpad
