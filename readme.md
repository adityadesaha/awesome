# Hello there.
This is my awesomewm config folder. Probably the worst
possible codebase you've ever laid your eyes upon. Hopefully
I'll manage to make it better someday. I'm neither a
programmer nor do I know lua, so possibly someday might
never come.

## TODO:
* make it so that the bar shows minimized windows in tiled/floating
  mode, but shows all active windows in max mode
